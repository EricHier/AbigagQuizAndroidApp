# Abigag Quiz Android App
Android application as a quiz input device for the associated python desktop program.

With this software you can take local quiz shows without needing an internet connection. For this, the PC with the desktop software must be in the same LAN so that both can communicate with each other via UDP packets.

By default, the app shows four buttons for the corresponding answer options, the answers are then transferred to the PC at the push of a button.

Alternatively, there is a button mode, which sends a message directly to the software when the button is touched, which can then react accordingly.

This software was developed for the graduation ceremony and has not been used since. If you are interested in this project, please feel free to contact me.
